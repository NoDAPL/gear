# gear
Buy, sell, request, swap, and gift gear needed to sustain the mission of water protectors.

## Individual Listings
Similar to Craigslist, this tool should let users list and locate gear at camps. Users can search for what they need and place holds for pick-up. If gear is not available, the item(s) can go on a wishlist so that supporters can know what's needed.
